% define a function the left side is the output variables the rigt side is 
% the input variables. Vanout is the output phase volatge, Vanout_new is 
% the output voltage signal in a specific time interval namely 1/frequency, frequency
% is the frequency of the three pahse sinusodial signal, tout is simulation run 
% time,tout_new is time interval of the output phase volatge and pahse current signal from 
% 5*L*R to (5*L*R+(1/frequency)),it is saved as a matrix. f is a matrix which contanis all ticks of frequency achse of
% FFT spectrum analysis. Iout is the output phase current signal, 
% only phase a is analyzied since the only difference between phase a, b, c  
% is a phase delay of -2*pi/3. In other words a b and c is symmertric. P1 is a matrix which contains spectrum of the FFT analysis. 
% THD_percentage represents the total harmonic distortaion of the 
% output current signal. simOut is the Simulink file output, 
% in Simulink file SVPWM_slef.slx the variables are saved in model workspace for 
% further processing. partfourierexperiment_pwm_1 is the name of
% this MATLAB file, Furthermore is is also the name of the involked
% function. stepsize is the 1/samplefrequency which indicates how many
% distance between two neighbouring sampling point. V is the amplitude of
% the three phase sinusoidal signal. frequency represents the frequency of
% the three phase sinusoidal signal.R is the resistance of the electrcial
% machine, L is the inductance of the electrical machine. fs is the
% frequency of the carrier signal it can be sawtooth wave (Bipolar SPWM) or triangular
% wave (unipolar SPWM). Vdc is the DC-link volatge. stoptime is the simulation stoptime of
% the Simulink file. samplefrequency indicates how many sampling pouints are
% in one second time interval. u_sampletime is the sample time of the
% unitdelay block
